"# caching" 
Adavnced PHP - Cache in PHP , Optimize your server 


In this video tutorial
I am going to show you how caching work in PHP scripts.
Actually not only in PHP but also in any others scripting language you can apply this Technic.

So what is caching here in this tutorial.
Connecting with the MYSQL and retrieving data every time is time consuming with server responding.
Retrieving data from MYSQL uses a lot of resources of the server like CPU execution,loading into memory 
and that costs time & resources and server gets slow.Sometime client get response with 
MYSQL connection error or can see an error page 
when MYSQL connection queue is  overflow with a lot of request at a time.
So how can we overcome this Problem.
We can cache the data in a  file without connecting to the MYSQL every time.
We will retrieve data from MYSQL and will write that data in a file and can read that data from the file and not from MYSQL .

That can save us using cpu execution of the mysql retrieving data,can save resources of extra  loading from memory and system will be faster and respond time will be quicker.

We can solve huge traffic in this optimized way
